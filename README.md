Why this opensource project?
At TMK Labs, We believe that true engineers learn anything from first principles with 3 questions.

1. What is this concept?
2. Why should I learn this concept?
3. How can I create something out of it?
   And with this Open Source project, our goal is to share all the knowledge with the upcoming generations in a simple way.
